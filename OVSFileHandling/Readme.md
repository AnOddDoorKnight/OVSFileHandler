# Odd's Very Special File Handler

..Or OVSFileHandler for short.

This is a library that provides pathing that applied in unix or windows systems,
and uses Files/Directories metadata that doesn't explicitly mean that it exists.
Very similar to fileinfos in the existing System, but much more performant.
